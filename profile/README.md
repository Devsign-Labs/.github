# Welcome To Devsign Labs

Devsign Labs is an innovation workshop where we create interesting million dollar unpatented ideas that can be replicated to help the society in various ways.

Feel free to fork/contribute/replicate some of these ideas into interesting solutions (no need to give credit)

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
